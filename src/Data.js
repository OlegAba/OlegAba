    about: `InstaQR generates a live wallpaper by combining an image of your choice with 
    a scannable QR code. The QR code stores your share action (any link such as a social 
    media profile) and stays hidden until the live wallpaper is activated. Simply press into 
    the screen from your lockscreen and have the person you would like to share with to scan 
    the barcode from their camera app.`,
